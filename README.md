The aim of Bridge Span is simple. You must get the two inmates to the other side of the screen without being seen by the monsters. You can only move the characters one at a time and you only have six moves to complete the level.

As you progress through the game new monsters are introduced with different abilities. You will see as the levels become more challenging a fair amount of problem-solving and tactical play is required.
